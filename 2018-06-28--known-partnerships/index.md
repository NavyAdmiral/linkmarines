# CONFIRMED PARTNERSHIPS
--------------------
## zeppelin_os
Powered by openzeppelin, zeppelin_os makes the smart contract development process faster, easier and more secure.

> $1.5 billion worth of digital assets are powered by openzeppelin smart contracts"

[Confirmed by both zeppelin_os and ChainLink](https://blog.zeppelinos.org/chainlink-partnership/)


## Town Crier
> We're partnered with Cornell's IC3, to help launch the [first Intel SGX secured link between smart contracts and external data](https://create.smartcontract.com/#/contracts/cc3ea3c76b5a60f171e0eaf223146f34?tab=info). This more secure way of running an oracle is the future and we're glad to be moving it forward. [ChainLink website (under Cornell)](https://www.smartcontract.com/)

Town Crier is a patent-pending system developed by a team from Cornell's Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3). A notable team member includes Ari Jules, he was previously the Chief Scientist of RSA (The Security Division of EMC) and assisted in writing/peer-reviewing the ChainLink whitepaper.

The Town Crier system leverages trusted hardware (Intel SGX) to provide a strong guarantee that data comes from an existing, trustworthy source. It also provides confidentiality, enabling smart contracts to support confidential queries and even manage user credentials. - Town Crier website

## Factom
Factom stores the world's data on a decentralized system. Using blockchain technology for smart contracts, digital assets and database integrity.
> [SmartContract + Factom Announce Collaboration](https://www.factom.com/blog/smartcontract-factom-announce-collaboration)

## Request Network
Attempting to be an open-sourced, decentralised, and standardised PayPal. Plans to be currency-agnostic. Will also offer services such as accounting automation, IOT, and smart audit.

ChainLink is currently being investigated by Request network as a [potential solution](https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-december-22nd-2017-first-feedbacks-colossus-introducing-request-51fc3387a686) to allowing FIAT integration.

> Oracle security is really important. At the moment ChainLink decentralized oracles seem like a good solution. We are in regular contact with them. - Request Network Team
# Pontetial Partnerships
--------------------
## CHAINLINK + SWIFT
![Here](https://i.imgur.com/VTYgdzO.png)

ChainLink was one of the winners of Innotribe's Industry Challenge 2016. Innotribe, an innovation-focused segment of SWIFT, worked with ChainLink to develop a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate how ChainLink could automate bond coupon payments.

ChainLink successfully demonstrated their (PoC) at SWIFT's Sibos conference in October 2017. The PoC pulled off-chain data (interest rates) from 5 banks (Barclays, BNP Paribas, Fidelity, Societe Generale and Santander) and fed it into a smart contract that calculated the bond coupon payment. An ISO20022 SWIFT message was then generated to send the bond coupon payment.

[Mentioned by *Laura Girod*](https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-november-10th-2017-a57193780ddf) *of Request Network*:  

> Such an oracle can be created through partnerships (i.e. SWIFT/ChainLink, many others will come), with a tokenized version of these currencies or with a mix of both (a bank could participate in the Oracle by moving tokenized currencies but it would be transparent for their customers)

## Microsoft

## Docusign

Electronic Signature Industry Leader company with $9bn market cap is speculated to be working with Chainlink. Founder of Docusign [has retweeted this infamous line](https://twitter.com/nazarETHereum/status/990285707791949825):
> Glad to have you as a $LINK Marine @tgonser
Sergey was on a panel at SXSW alongside Tom Gosner. They didn't makeany announcements about partnerships, but it's suspected that they've been working together for some time.

[In this post] (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/smart-contracts-deals-without-lawyers-tom-gonser/) it is also believed Tom Gonser references chainlink.

> Finally, we’ll hear from Sergey Nazarov, CEO of Smartcontract.com about the importance of oracles to get data in and out of smart contracts securely.

> Where will the data come from to connect smart contracts to the data they need to make decisions? How will we know we can rely on these data sources?

> Do smart contracts require a decentralized "trustless" block chain to operate? Or can these same contracts be built on ‘trusted’ networks?

## CEEK

Company founded in 2015. Currently offers VR music experiences. Currently, they have 674k Facebook fans, sell their own VR headsets, and have Lady Gaga, Bastille, One Republic etc. VR experiences through their app.

ChainLink is currently listed as the oracle solution for CEEK VR in their whitepaper.

ChainLink will be used by CEEK to offer services for direct purchase via smart contract, such as “on-chain” subscriptions.
